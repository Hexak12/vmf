<img src="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/images/3/34/Hammer_splash.png">

This repository is a personal archive and development workspace for Source engine maps and mods (Half-Life 2, Episode One, Episode Two, and Garry's Mod).

### Contents
- Map VMF/PRT/BSP sources and various mod files.
- Development and experimental maps; many files are works-in-progress or archived experiments.

### Recommended tools
- Hammer++ — editor for creating and editing VMF files: https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/download.html
- BSPSource — decompile BSPs to VMF: https://github.com/ata4/bspsrc
- gmpublisher — publish maps to Garry's Mod: https://github.com/WilliamVenner/gmpublisher

### Maps of note
`gmod/pentapolegmod/maps/pentapole.bsp` — one of the more complete maps in this collection.
- Development (dev) build: `gmod/demogmod.vmf` / `gmod/demogmod.bsp` (dev: `demogmod`).
- Sandbox (dev) build: `gmod/demogmodbox.vmf` / `gmod/demogmodbox.bsp` (dev: `demogmodbox`).

Most recent `jail` build included: `jailhl2build3.bsp`.

### Status
- Many maps are in alpha or experimental state and may be incomplete or unpolished.

### Contributing / workflow notes
- If you want to modify a BSP, decompile it with BSPSource to get a VMF, edit in Hammer++ and recompile with your preferred toolchain.
- Prefer submitting VMF/PRT sources when possible so others can reproduce edits.
- Open an issue or contact the maintainer with proposed changes or questions.

### Maintainer
- Repository author (local personal collection).
